# Hi, I'm Samuel Adegboyega (Sammy750-cyber)

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a developer and cybersecurity practitioner focused on Python, web development, and ethical security research. I build tools, run controlled experiments in my personal lab, and document findings and utilities that help improve software and network resilience.

## About Me

- Currently building professional expertise in **Cybersecurity**, with emphasis on penetration testing, network security, and digital forensics.
- Strong background in **Python programming**, **Backend web development**, and **automation scripting**, applied to both software projects and security tooling.
- I integrate security into software development—designing, testing, and hardening applications and infrastructure.
- Portfolio: [https://portfolio-main-three-phi.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-main-three-phi.vercel.app/)

## Progress & Current Focus

I have deep-dived into ethical hacking and networking through structured study and extensive hands-on practice. My learning combines methodical labs, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and real-world-style exercises in isolated, legal environments.

Highlights of my progress:

- **Lab work & vulnerable machines:** Completed practical exploitation and post-exploitation exercises on targets such as *Metasploitable*, *DVWA*, *Kioptrix*, and Android test environments.
- **Network security & traffic analysis:** Practiced man-in-the-middle (MITM) scenarios, packet capture and analysis with **Wireshark** and **tcpdump**, and implemented basic network defenses.
- **Reconnaissance & enumeration:** Performed subdomain discovery, port and service scans, and asset mapping using **Nmap**, **Sublist3r**, **assetfinder**, and **Amass**.
- **Tooling & automation:** Built and adapted Python scripts to automate reconnaissance, scanning, and logging workflows for repeatable security assessments.
- **OSINT investigations:** Used open-source techniques to collect and analyze publicly available information in a disciplined, ethical manner.
- **Security mindset:** Practiced responsible disclosure principles and maintained strict boundaries—only testing systems I own or have explicit permission to assess.

Roadmap and current priorities:

- Continue building experience in **web application security**, **network defense**, and **incident response**.
- Harden personal lab infrastructure and explore containerized, reproducible lab environments.
- Prepare for industry-recognized certification paths and deepen knowledge of exploitation frameworks and mitigation techniques.

## Cybersecurity Journey

My approach blends theoretical learning with practical, repeatable labs. I version-control reports, scripts, and lab notes to track progress and share reproducible findings.

### Key Areas of Experience

- **Penetration Testing:** Hands-on practice in controlled lab environments with vulnerable targets.
- **MITM & Network Attacks:** Performed interception and analysis to understand attack vectors and defenses.
- **Vulnerability Research:** Focused on reconnaissance, scanning, and validation using standard tooling.
- **OSINT:** Conducted structured information-gathering exercises for investigations and threat modeling.
- **Defensive Security:** Implemented basic defensive measures and practiced incident response workflows.
- **Windows Powershell reverseshell:** I created a reverse shell generator that generates payload and  create a shell remotely to any windows system.

## Projects

- **[Instagram-likes](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/Instagram-likes):** Python automation for managing Instagram likes.
- **[Project Library](https://project-library-iota.vercel.app/):** Tool for organizing project ideas and tracking progress.
- **[Keyboard Hero](https://keyboard-hero-pink.vercel.app/):** Typing practice game with an interactive interface.
- **[YouTube Video Downloader](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/YoutubeDL):** Python-based tool for saving YouTube videos.
- **[Port Scanner](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/port-scanner):** Concurrent TCP connect-style port scanner for learning and authorized assessments.
- **[Password checker](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/password_checker):** A simple, privacy-first Password Strength Checker implemented in Python. The tool evaluates password strength using length, character classes, entropy estimates, pattern detection, and optional dictionary and HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) breach checks (k-anonymity). It is designed as a reusable library plus a small CLI wrapper.
- **[Reveerseshell generatore](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/reverse-shell-generator.git):** I created a reverse shell generator that generates payload majorly in powershell code and works pretty well on windows powershell. However, i added extra features like bash and python but it's not 100% guaranteed to work all the time.
- **[Facebbook mail sender](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/facebook_mail_sender.git):** This tool consist of three main facebook email templates, this gives the privilege of simulating phishing attacks and credential harvesting through gmail in safe and secured lab setup.
- **[Kryptex](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/kryptex.git):** Production-grade command-line tool for secure key wrapping and file encryption using industry-standard cryptography. Similar to OpenSSL but better.
- **[RedTrace](https://github.com/Sammy750-cyber/RedTrace.git):** RedTrace is a vulnerabilty scanner, It performs a concurrent TCP connect scan, basic banner grabbing, and heuristic CVE matching using a local CVE JSON database.

    This tool was built upon one of my previous projects (ports scanner), but with additional features. However this is the first version of this added features so nothing much to expect from it for now. Next version will be integrated with CVE-DB API instead of the static DB that this is currently running on.
